An operations workflow automation project that classifies LINE user messages, assigns issue severity tiers, routes cases to responsible teams, and logs tickets for follow-up.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates an internal operations support system for retail, logistics, and store operations teams.

The system receives unstructured messages through LINE, classifies the issue, assigns it to the right owner, determines the urgency level, and records the case as a ticket.

It was designed as a portfolio project to demonstrate chatbot integration, workflow automation, routing logic, and operations analytics thinking.

## 💼 Business Problem

Operations teams often receive large volumes of unstructured messages from stores, customers, drivers, and internal teams.

Common issues include:

- Inventory shortages
- Customer complaints
- Delivery delays
- Store operation issues
- System errors
- Pricing or promotion problems
- Payment issues
- Product quality concerns

Without automation, these messages require manual review, routing, and follow-up. This project reduces manual coordination work by routing issues to the right responsible team automatically.

## ✨ Key Features

- LINE chatbot integration
- Webhook-based Flask backend
- Rule-based issue classification
- Multi-category detection
- Tier 0 / Tier 1 / Tier 2 urgency assignment
- Owner routing logic
- Ticket logging to CSV
- Daily summary generation
- Cloudflare Tunnel for local webhook testing
- Portfolio-ready demo structure

## 🧠 Tier Logic

| Tier | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 0 | AI / automation can respond directly | FAQ, simple process questions |
| Tier 1 | Human review needed, not urgent | Store hours, shelf updates, delivery follow-up |
| Tier 2 | Urgent escalation | Stockout, customer complaint, payment issue, system error, food safety issue |

---

## 👥 Owner Mapping

| Category | Responsible Owner | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| Inventory Issue | Procurement Team | Tier 2 |
| Customer Complaint | Customer Support Team | Tier 2 |
| Delivery Issue | Logistics Team | Tier 1 |
| Store Operations | Store Manager | Tier 1 |
| System Issue | IT Team | Tier 2 |
| Pricing / Promotion Issue | Commercial Team | Tier 1 |
| Payment Issue | Finance Team | Tier 2 |
| Food Safety / Quality Issue | Quality Assurance Team | Tier 2 |
| General FAQ | AI Bot | Tier 0 |
